        <h2 id="history">The site's history</h2>
        <p>This site was created on 9/6/2023 as a project for my web programming class.
            While making it, I started learning a bit of Javascript. While JS isn't especially difficult, using it in
            conjunction with html/css is. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed putting this site together.
        </p>
        <h2 id="purpose">Purpose of the site</h2>
        <p>While I had created this site for a class project, the reason I chose to create a Flash site specifically
            is because I was amazed at how far Ruffle came since the Flash end of life. Not only has Ruffle been able to
            run many of my childhood favorite Flash games, It also has been able to make them look better.
            My hope was to be able to show off these games running on a modern Flash implementation and maybe even help
            people enjoy these games once more.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how">How the site works</h2>
        <p>This site is able to run Flash games due to an open source project called
            <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> which is a complete reimplementation of Adobe's Shockwave Flash
            Player. To better understand the difference between Flash and Ruffle, I have created a table.
        <table>
            <caption>Flash vs. Ruffle</caption>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Flash</th>
                <th>Ruffle</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Time period</td>
                <td>1996-2020*</td>
                <td>2019-present</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Language</td>
                <td>ActionScript</td>
                <td>Rust</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Security</td>
                <td>Poor</td>
                <td>Good</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h6>*While public support for Flash ended in 2020, companies that had enterprise contracts with Adobe recieved
            support beyond 2020.</h6>
        </p>
        <h2 id="support"></h2>
        <p>Due to the switch to Ruffle, a site like this can run on many more platforms than Flash player could. These
            include but are not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>Android</li>
            <li>IOS</li>
            <li>Windows</li>
            <li>MacOS</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
        </ul>
